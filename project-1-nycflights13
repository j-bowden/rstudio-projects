# This is my first data analysis -type project, in which I try to apply
# some skills I have learned in R/RStudio to analyse real-world flight data.


# I use the "nycflights13" package associated with "tidyverse", which
# documents flight data out of New York airports in 2013. For more info
# on this package, see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf
